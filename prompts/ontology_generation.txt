Build me an ontology of {domain} with {N} Classes and {M} ObjectProperties, please. Provide the result as
1. List of Classes (one per line)
2. List of ObjectProperties (one per line)
3. List of subclass axioms in the format "A,B" (one per line, where A is a subclass of B)
4. List of domain axioms in the format P,D (one per line, where P is a property, D is its domain - leave empty if there is no suitable class)
5. List of range axioms in the format P,R (one per line, where P is a property, R is its range - leave empty if there is no suitable class)
